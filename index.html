        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Growing up in New Mexico I’ve learned to appreciate the natural beauty that surrounds us. The open skies, prickly pear cactus, and roadrunner bird are some of my favorite things about this place I call home.</p>
        <p>Before becoming a licensed esthetician in 2020, I spent several seasons working amongst urban conservation groups, learning about the plant and wildlife species that support our communities.</p>
        <p>Instead of working against the dry climate of the high-desert, I use natural botanical products from New Mexico that work <em>with</em> your skin to create a healthy, balanced ecosystem.</p>
        <p>My goal is to nourish your skin and enhance your natural beauty while providing a moment of pause to relax + rejuvenate.</p>
